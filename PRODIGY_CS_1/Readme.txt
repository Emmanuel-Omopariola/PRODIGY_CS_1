Caesar Cipher Web App

This app demonstrates a basic Caesar Cipher, one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption.

 What it does:
- You enter a message and a number (shift value).
- The app shifts each letter by that number in the alphabet.
  For example, if you shift "A" by 3 â†’ you get "D".

 Example:
- Message: HELLO
- Shift: 3
- Encrypted: KHOOR

Use the Decrypt button to reverse the process!

ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- Letters only shift alphabetically. Symbols and spaces are left unchanged.
- Shift value wraps around. For example, shifting "Z" by 1 becomes "A".

Perfect for learning the basics of encryption and how web apps work!
